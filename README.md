# FabulousFashion
My first HTML practice project exploring page structure, links, media, and accessibility basics.
# Fabulous Fashion 2026

## About this project
This project was created as one of my first hands-on HTML practice pages. While the content is presented as a fashion feature focused on trends and innovation for 2026, the primary goal was to learn and practice core web development fundamentals.

## What I practiced
- Basic HTML document structure
- Headings, paragraphs, and lists
- Internal navigation using anchor links
- External links and embedded media
- Image accessibility using alt text
- Organizing content with divs and sections

## Why this project matters
This page represents an early milestone in my learning journey. It reflects my growth through experimentation, problem-solving, and applying concepts beyond the minimum requirements of a guided lesson. Rather than focusing on perfection, this project captures a moment of progress and confidence-building.

## Notes
The project is intentionally preserved in its original form to document my learning process at this stage.
